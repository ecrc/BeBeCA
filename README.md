This readme file contains information about using the contents of this framework
to build and test your betweenness centrality approximation algorithms.

----------------------------------------------
-                  Contents                  -
----------------------------------------------
Included in this release are the following files and directories:
  - README                        This document
  - Evaluation_Methodology/       Contains all evaluation scripts, the graphs and 
								  the exact betweenness centrality scores that is 
								  used for evaluating betwenness centraity approximation 
								  algorithms.
  - Source_Code/                  Contains the source coude for several approxiamtion
								  algorithms presented in the paper. 
                                  
----------------------------------------------
-               Getting started              -
----------------------------------------------
All the required scripts, graph inputs and the exact betweenness centrality
scores are available in the directory Evaluation_Methodology/ and all you have
to do is to run the script Evaluation_Methodology/BeBeCa.sh to get the following
evaluation metrics:
	1- Average Error
	2- Maximum Error
	3- Top 1% Hit
	4- Kindall-tau Distance
Evaluation_Methodology/BeBeCa.sh takes as arguments: 
	1- The exact betweenness centrality scores file path. 
	2- The approximate betweenness centrality scores file path.
	3- The output file name that will contain the evaluation metrics. 
For further details about the evaluation framework, please read 
Evaluation_Methodology/README.txt

All of our approxiamtion algorithms implmentations are available in the directory 
Source_Code/ along with the way to compile each one of the approximation algorithms.
For further details about how to compile and run each of the algorithms, please read 
Source_Code/README.txt
